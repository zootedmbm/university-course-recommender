# University Course Recommender

## 📜 Overview
This project is a **course recommender system** for university students based on their previous grades and interests. It suggests elective courses based on:
- Past course performance (grades)
- Interests (tags like Data Science, AI, Web Dev, etc.)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Streamlit (for web interface)
- Scikit-learn (optional for machine learning)

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MuhammadBinMehmood/university-course-recommender.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Add machine learning-based recommendations (using collaborative filtering or content-based filtering)
- Integrate real-time data from university systems
